This Loan Qualification Checker is a JavaScript app that determines if an applicant qualifies for a duplex, condo, or car loan based on their annual income and credit score. The app includes a function, getLoanMessage(), which evaluates the applicant's qualifications against predefined loan criteria and returns an appropriate message, such as:

"You qualify for a duplex, condo, and car loan."
"You qualify for a condo and car loan."
"You qualify for a car loan."
"You don't qualify for any loans."
The program uses conditional checks to compare the applicant's income and credit score with the minimum requirements for each loan type.
