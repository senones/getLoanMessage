// Step 1: Declare variables for the minimum values
const minIncomeForDuplex = 60000;
const minCreditScoreForDuplex = 700;
const minIncomeForCondo = 45000;
const minCreditScoreForCondo = 680;
const minIncomeForCar = 30000;
const minCreditScoreForCar = 650;

// Step 2: Create the getLoanMessage function
function getLoanMessage(annualIncome, creditScore) {
    if (annualIncome >= minIncomeForDuplex && creditScore >= minCreditScoreForDuplex) {
        return "You qualify for a duplex, condo, and car loan.";
    } 
    if (annualIncome >= minIncomeForCondo && creditScore >= minCreditScoreForCondo) {
        return "You qualify for a condo and car loan.";
    } 
    if (annualIncome >= minIncomeForCar && creditScore >= minCreditScoreForCar) {
        return "You qualify for a car loan.";
    } 
    if (annualIncome < minIncomeForCar && creditScore < minCreditScoreForCar) {
        return "You don't qualify for any loans.";
    }
    return undefined; // This case handles when no criteria are met
}

// Step 3: Test the function with different values
const duplexLoanMsg = getLoanMessage(85000, 850); // "You qualify for a duplex, condo, and car loan."
const condoLoanMsg = getLoanMessage(65000, 690);  // "You qualify for a condo and car loan."
const carLoanMsg = getLoanMessage(45000, 660);    // "You qualify for a car loan."
const noLoanMsg = getLoanMessage(25000, 550);     // "You don't qualify for any loans."

// Step 4: Log the results to the console
console.log(duplexLoanMsg); // "You qualify for a duplex, condo, and car loan."
console.log(condoLoanMsg);  // "You qualify for a condo and car loan."
console.log(carLoanMsg);    // "You qualify for a car loan."
console.log(noLoanMsg);     // "You don't qualify for any loans."



This Loan Qualification Checker is a JavaScript app that determines if an applicant qualifies for a duplex, condo, or car loan based on their annual income and credit score. The app includes a function, getLoanMessage(), which evaluates the applicant's qualifications against predefined loan criteria and returns an appropriate message, such as:

"You qualify for a duplex, condo, and car loan."
"You qualify for a condo and car loan."
"You qualify for a car loan."
"You don't qualify for any loans."
The program uses conditional checks to compare the applicant's income and credit score with the minimum requirements for each loan type.
